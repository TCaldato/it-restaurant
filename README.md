# Introduction

## About the Project IT Restaurant

A Full-Stack website was developed for this project, which utilizes business logic to manage a centralized dataset. A role-based access authentication mechanism was implemented to ensure secure access to the website's data. The website was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and the Django and Bootstrap frameworks, with Postgres serving as the relational database. An Agile approach was employed throughout the project. The project also involved the implementation of authorization, authentication, and permission features in a Full-Stack web application solution. Furthermore, the project utilized object-based software concepts to achieve its goals.

## UX

### User-Stories

In the Agile approach, a "user story" is a technique that assists in capturing the user's perspective and needs. It is a simple, yet powerful tool that shifts the focus from documenting requirements to discussing them. A user story is a brief, informal description from a user's point of view that explains what they want to achieve with the product. It encourages collaboration between the development team and the user, as it sparks meaningful conversations about the features and functionality that the user story represents. This approach promotes a better understanding of the user's needs, resulting in a product that meets their requirements and delivers value to the user.

The Agile User Story technique has been documented in a separate file. You can check by clicking [Here](.....)
